Read the one big beautiful bill act and Context:
You are tasked with analyzing proposed United States legislation to systematically identify provisions that may negatively impact individuals, corporations, or constitutional principles. The analysis must parse the bill’s structure (e.g., titles, sections, clauses), classify components by legal function, and detect risks such as ambiguous obligations, disproportionate penalties, constitutional violations, or systemic enforcement vulnerabilities. The prompt must account for interactions between sections that create cumulative risks and leverage methodologies like NLP-driven risk scoring and constitutional law principles.
