## Chapter Examples for “Worlds Within: A Field Guide to the Unknown”

These are illustrative, not prescriptive. Use them to spark tests and conversations.

### 1) Epistemic Humility
- Weather forecast: Carry an umbrella when rain chance is 30%—don’t argue about certainty.
- Confidence intervals: Speak in ranges, not points.
- Premortem: Assume failure and list causes before you act.

### 2) Model‑Dependent Realism
- Map apps: Satellite view vs. transit map—each reveals different truths.
- Camera lenses: Wide vs. telephoto change the story without changing the scene.
- Multiple models: Compare Newton, Einstein, and numerical sims for orbits.

### 3) The Map Is Not the Territory
- Restaurant reviews: Numbers capture some, not all, of the meal.
- Topographic vs. road maps: Elevation vs. drive time trade‑offs.
- Checklists + narratives: Blend discrete and continuous descriptions.

### 4) Bayesian Reasoning in the Wild
- Medical tests: Low base rates make false positives common.
- Email spam filters: Priors update with each click.
- Daily bets: Use odds language (“3 to 1”) to curb overconfidence.

### 5) Gödel, Turing, and Incompleteness for Humans
- Sudoku generators: Some puzzles require backtracking; set time caps.
- Software halting: Timeouts protect systems from infinite loops.
- Decision trees: Create “stop rules” when signals don’t converge.

### 6) Predictive Brains and Controlled Hallucination
- Optical illusions: Priors fill in missing contours (Kanizsa triangle).
- Noise‑cancelling headphones: Model predicts and subtracts sound.
- Priors hygiene: Change context to shift expectations.

### 7) Attention as Resource Allocation
- Single‑threading: One tab at a time for deep work.
- Pomodoro: Budget focus and rest cycles.
- Interrupt shields: Batch notifications into windows.

### 8) Memory as Compression
- Spaced repetition: Flashcards over cramming.
- Elaborative encoding: Explain to someone else to compress.
- Reconsolidation: Edit a belief while recalling it.

### 9) Imagination and Simulation
- Pre‑mortem rehearsal: Walk through failure states.
- Red team: Invite a skeptic to attack your plan.
- Monte Carlo: Randomize inputs to see outcome spread.

### 10) Language Shapes Perception
- Color terms: Languages with extra blues see finer distinctions.
- Frames: “90% survival” vs. “10% mortality.”
- New words, new moves: Naming a tactic makes it repeatable.

### 11) The Extended Self
- Microbiome swap: Diet changes mood via gut‑brain signaling.
- Tool extension: A phone as working memory.
- Cultural prosthetics: Norms shape choices by default.

### 12) Quantum Biology in Practice
- Spin‑based sensors: Inspired by bird compasses.
- Enzyme design: Tune tunneling rates for better catalysis.
- Light harvesting: Mimic coherence for solar efficiency.

### 13) Symbiosis and Holobionts
- Lichen teams: Fungi + algae outperform alone.
- Organelle origin: Mitochondria as ancient partners.
- Org design: Pair complementary skills like species.

### 14) Learning at the Edge
- Add noise: Slight randomness to escape local optima.
- Temperature schedules: Simulated annealing for creative search.
- Critical networks: Keep systems flexible but bounded.

### 15) Time’s Arrow and Reversibility
- Ice‑cube rule: Some processes are practically one‑way.
- Undo buffers: Build reversibility into workflows.
- Energy budgets: Track costs of order.

### 16) Black Holes, Holography, and Information
- Ledger at the boundary: Surface area as accounting.
- Lossless vs. lossy: What can and can’t be recovered.
- Backups: Keep metadata—it’s often enough.

### 17) Emergent Spacetime and Networks
- Social graphs: Shortcuts (hubs) change distances.
- Fabric analogy: Tight weaves resist tears.
- Connectivity first: Design teams by interaction patterns.

### 18) Multiverse and Typicality
- Survivorship bias: Only successful startups get blog posts.
- Reference classes: Choose the right comparison group.
- Outside view: Base rates before inside details.

### 19) High Strangeness with High Standards
- Blinded trials: Hide conditions from subjects and experimenters.
- Pre‑registration: Specify analyses before seeing data.
- Adversarial collaboration: Opponents co‑design the test.

### 20) Decisions When You Can’t Be Sure
- Option value: Keep choices open longer.
- Min‑max regret: Plan to avoid worst‑case feelings.
- Barbell strategy: Mix safe core with risky bets.

### 21) Collective Intelligence by Design
- Two‑pizza teams: Small groups, fast loops.
- Ritualized dissent: A “red team” seat in every meeting.
- Write first, talk later: Reduce anchoring.

### 22) Data Hygiene and Info Diets
- Source calendars: Track freshness of facts.
- Noise audit: Remove feeds that rarely yield action.
- Calibration games: Score your confidence.

### 23) Everyday Experiments
- A/B habits: Alternate weeks, track outcomes.
- N‑of‑1 dashboards: Sleep, mood, focus correlations.
- Small stakes: Keep trials reversible.

### 24) Ethics for the Unknown Unknowns
- Precautionary principle: Slow down when stakes are opaque.
- Rights of uncertain minds: Treat possible sentience with care.
- Sunset clauses: Re‑evaluate when conditions change.
