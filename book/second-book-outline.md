## Book Thesis — Worlds Within: A Field Guide to the Unknown

- This second book is a practical and philosophical companion: how to think, decide, and live amid radical uncertainty. It translates frontier ideas into methods for inquiry, collaboration, and meaning‑making without overclaiming.
- The throughline: epistemic humility + disciplined curiosity + collective intelligence.

### Super‑Chapter I: Limits of Knowing (Epistemology for Everyday Life)
1) Epistemic Humility
- Plan: Distinguish between ignorance, risk, and deep uncertainty; adopt provisional beliefs.
2) Model‑Dependent Realism
- Plan: Treat theories as lenses; compare predictions across models, not metaphysical labels.
3) The Map Is Not the Territory
- Plan: Use multiple representations; triangulate via measurement, narrative, and simulation.
4) Bayesian Reasoning in the Wild
- Plan: Update beliefs with likelihoods and priors; avoid certainty language.
5) Gödel, Turing, and Incompleteness for Humans
- Plan: Embrace limits; design stop rules and escalation paths when answers don’t exist.

### Super‑Chapter II: Minds as Model Builders (Cognition as Computation)
6) Predictive Brains and Controlled Hallucination
- Plan: Perception as inference; manage priors via attention, context, and uncertainty estimates.
7) Attention as Resource Allocation
- Plan: Treat attention as a budget; apply “single‑threading” for complex tasks.
8) Memory as Compression
- Plan: Use spaced repetition, generative recall, and reconsolidation windows.
9) Imagination and Simulation
- Plan: Mental models for scenario planning; red‑team your own beliefs.
10) Language Shapes Perception
- Plan: Naming as constraint; use diverse vocabularies to widen perception.

### Super‑Chapter III: Life as Information Flow (Biology Reframed)
11) The Extended Self: Microbiome, Tools, and Culture
- Plan: Expand identity beyond skin; track how external systems change cognition.
12) Quantum Biology in Practice
- Plan: What magnetoreception, tunneling, and coherence might mean for sensors and medicine.
13) Symbiosis and Holobionts
- Plan: Cooperation as computation; design teams like ecosystems.
14) Learning at the Edge: Criticality and Noise
- Plan: Harness variability and stochastic resonance for creativity.

### Super‑Chapter IV: A Cosmos of Puzzles (Physics Without Finality)
15) Time’s Arrow and Reversibility
- Plan: Separate thermodynamic, psychological, and cosmological arrows; design around asymmetries.
16) Black Holes, Holography, and Information
- Plan: Use conservation constraints as thinking tools; reason about what must be true.
17) Emergent Spacetime and Networks
- Plan: Model connectivity and flow; explore graph thinking for real systems.
18) Multiverse, Anthropic Filters, and Typicality
- Plan: Avoid selection bias; reason under observer effects.
19) High Strangeness with High Standards
- Plan: UAPs, psi, and anomalies as adversarial testing grounds; insist on blinded, pre‑registered protocols.

### Super‑Chapter V: Practice Under Uncertainty (Designing Life and Work)
20) Decisions When You Can’t Be Sure
- Plan: Robust satisficing, regret minimization, and option value.
21) Collective Intelligence by Design
- Plan: Small‑group protocols, dissent norms, and rapid feedback loops.
22) Data Hygiene and Info Diets
- Plan: Calibrate sources; measure signal‑to‑noise and novelty.
23) Everyday Experiments
- Plan: N‑of‑1 trials, A/B habits, and personal dashboards.
24) Ethics for the Unknown Unknowns
- Plan: Reversibility, harm bounds, and rights for possible minds.
