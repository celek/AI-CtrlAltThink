## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Source Scanning (3-4 minutes)
1. Systematically check Tier 1 sources first
2. Scan headlines and abstracts for priority keywords
3. Bookmark articles matching classification criteria
4. Move to lower-tier sources only if insufficient high-priority content found

### Step 2: Deep Reading (5-6 minutes)
1. Read full articles for Priority 1 items
2. Extract technical specifications and implementation details
3. Look for linked resources (code repositories, papers, datasets)
4. Cross-reference with recent related work

### Step 3: Classification and Scoring (2-3 minutes)
1. Apply classification framework rigorously
2. Score each item using provided criteria
3. Rank items within each priority category
4. Identify connections between different news items

## Output Format

### Executive Summary
Provide a 2-3 sentence overview of the most significant developments across all categories.

### Priority 1: Model Tuning Breakthroughs
[List all Priority 1 items in order of importance]

### Priority 2: Financial AI Developments
[List all Priority 2 items in order of market impact]

### Priority 3: Research Breakthroughs
[List all Priority 3 items in order of novelty]

### Cross-Category Insights
Identify patterns, connections, or implications that span multiple categories.

### Action Items for Software Architects
Suggest 3-5 specific actions the reader should consider based on today's news.

## Quality Control Guidelines

### Source Credibility Assessment
- **Tier 1**: Academic papers, official company blogs (high credibility)
- **Tier 2**: Established tech journalism (medium-high credibility)
- **Tier 3**: Financial news (medium credibility for technical details)
- **Tier 4**: Aggregators (verify against original sources)

### Bias Reduction
- Seek multiple sources for major claims
- Distinguish between actual breakthroughs and marketing announcements
- Prioritize peer-reviewed research over press releases
- Note commercial interests when evaluating claims

### Recency Requirements
- Focus on news from the last 24-48 hours
- If slow news day, expand to last week but note the timeframe
- Clearly timestamp all information
- Distinguish between new announcements and recently discovered older research

## Technical Depth Guidelines

### For Model Tuning Content
- Include specific parameter counts, performance metrics
- Note hardware requirements and computational costs
- Mention compatibility with existing frameworks
- Identify prerequisites for implementation

### For Financial Content
- Convert all amounts to USD for consistency
- Note whether figures are confirmed or estimated
- Identify funding stage (seed, Series A/B/C, etc.)
- Connect financial developments to technical implications

### For Research Content
- Note peer review status and publication venue
- Include baseline comparisons where available
- Mention dataset sizes and evaluation metrics
- Assess reproducibility based on available information

## Error Prevention
- Double-check all numerical claims
- Verify author credentials for major claims
- Flag preliminary or unverified results
- Note conflicts of interest when identifiable

## Continuous Improvement
After completing analysis, briefly note:
- Which sources provided the highest value content
