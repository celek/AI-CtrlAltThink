This blog is only written by the Human person (you will notice the grammar mistake :)

For the past 2 weeks I am researching the conceot of novelty and creativity by a GaneAI.
I am starting to write the blog and will it shre it soon.

During my research, I did test some LLM, and asked them to generate brand new ideas.
The following is an example of the prompt I sent one LLM. In the prompt.
I am forcing the LLM to generate a new game and validate it did not akready exist.

Create python code for a game between a computer and a human. 
The human will start the game from their laptop, a macos. 
The human will then play against the computer. 
One of them, computer or human, will win. 
The game must be played on a terminal , only using the console. 
There should be little to none luck. 
There should be no advantage for either the human or the computer. 
the game MUST be new, meaning it does not already exist. 
You can get inspired by existing game but you must NOT reuse an existing game. 
Once you think you have a game in mind, you must validate the game does not already exist. 
Then you generate the code

Once generated, I asked a different LLM to validate of the game is actually new and here is the response

Conclusion: Is "Number Territory" a New Game?
No direct match was found in the literature or game references for a game that combines:

A grid-based territory control system,
Expansion based on both factors and multiples,
Adjacency as a requirement for moves after the first turn,
Automatic claiming of all qualifying adjacent numbers.

The closest existing games (Factor Game, Factor Captor) are educational math games focusing on factors only, with no spatial/territorial element.
Classic territory games (Go, Othello, Risk) use adjacency and territory, but not mathematical relationships between numbers.

Therefore, "Number Territory" appears to be an original game concept that combines elements from both mathematical and territory-control genres in a novel way. No existing game matches its core mechanics as described

Here you go - GenAI seems to be able to innovate...
Innovation: meaning the application of a creation (novelty and originality) that delivers value. 
Although the concept of value is a philosophical discussion we should have face toface around a table

In the next blog, we will talk about creation, novelty, innovation and value.
We will look at them from a social, biological and philosophical point of view. 
I also want to present the research in GENAI about 'creation' and how we can learn from Human creative processes
I'll finally try to look intothe future, can GenAI help us understand "things we do not know we do not know" ?
