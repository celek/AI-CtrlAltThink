**ADAPTIVE AI PAPER ANALYZER**
*Quick Assessment for AI/ML Engineers*

**STEP 0: Paper Classification** [30 seconds]
Identify: □ Empirical Results □ Theoretical Advance □ Survey/Review □ Industry Application
Time Budget: □ 5min Scan □ 15min Analysis □ 30min Deep Dive

**STEP 1: Executive Summary** [2-5 minutes based on time budget]
- **Core Claim**: What's the main technical breakthrough? (1 sentence)
- **Evidence Quality**: Strong empirical validation / Theoretical proof / Anecdotal results
- **Key Numbers**: Best metric improvement, dataset size, computational cost
- **Reproducibility Signal**: Code available? Clear methodology? Industry standard benchmarks?

**STEP 2: Innovation Assessment** [Conditional - skip for time-constrained analysis]
IF empirical: Map technical components to existing systems architecture
IF theoretical: Identify mathematical/algorithmic novelty vs incremental improvement  
IF survey: Extract consensus findings and research gap identification

**STEP 3: Critical Red Flags** [Always include - 2 minutes max]
□ Cherry-picked benchmarks □ Missing baselines □ Unrealistic assumptions
□ Computational costs hidden □ Limited reproducibility info □ Overfitted results
□ Safety concerns unaddressed □ Scalability questions ignored

**STEP 4: Engineering Reality Check** [3-5 minutes]
- **Production Readiness**: Ready now / Needs engineering / Research prototype only
- **Integration Complexity**: Drop-in replacement / Moderate refactoring / System redesign
- **Resource Requirements**: Standard hardware / Specialized setup / Prohibitive costs
- **Adoption Timeline**: Immediate / 6-12 months / 2+ years

**STEP 5: Strategic Value** [2 minutes]
