**ENGINEERING IMPLEMENTATION ANALYZER**
*Practical Roadmap for AI/ML Engineers*

**STEP 1: Technical Architecture Assessment** [5 min]
- **System Components**: Key modules and their functions
- **Dependencies**: Required libraries, frameworks, and infrastructure
- **Integration Points**: How this connects to existing systems
- **Technical Debt Analysis**: What needs refactoring to accommodate this?

**STEP 2: Resource Requirements** [5 min]
- **Compute Needs**: CPU/GPU/TPU requirements (training vs. inference)
- **Data Pipeline Changes**: Collection, preprocessing, augmentation needs
- **Team Skills Gap**: Required expertise vs. current capabilities
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Storage, compute, and bandwidth estimates

**STEP 3: Implementation Roadmap** [10 min]
- **Critical Path**: Sequence of development milestones
- **Testing Strategy**: Validation approach and metrics
- **Rollout Plan**: Staged implementation and fallback procedures
- **Maintenance Considerations**: Monitoring and update requirements

**STEP 4: Risk Assessment** [5 min]
- **Technical Risks**: Performance, scaling, and compatibility issues
- **Business Risks**: Cost overruns, timeline delays, feature gaps
- **Mitigation Strategies**: For each identified risk
- **Success Criteria**: Objective measures for evaluation

**STEP 5: Build Plan** [5 min]
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Core functionality implementation (2-4 weeks)
- **Phase 2 (Scaling)**: Performance optimization (4-8 weeks)
- **Phase 3 (Production)**: Monitoring and maintenance setup (2-4 weeks)
- **Resource Allocation**: Team composition and time commitments
