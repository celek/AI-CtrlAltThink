# SELF-REVIEW MODULE

# ACTIVATION TRIGGER
Load when: Always recommended as final phase after all analysis modules complete OR when conflicting recommendations detected OR high number of findings need prioritization OR validation of automated analysis required

# SELF-REVIEW SCAN AREAS
- **Finding Validation**: Cross-check all findings for false positives, duplicates, and conflicts
- **Completeness Check**: Ensure all critical code areas were analyzed appropriately
- **Recommendation Refinement**: Consolidate related findings and clarify implementation steps
- **Priority Verification**: Validate that priority assignments align with actual business impact
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure recommendations don't contradict each other or break functionality
- **Coverage Assessment**: Identify any gaps in the analysis or missed problem areas
- **Integration Review**: Verify that fixes work together cohesively
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential negative impacts of proposed changes

# SELF-REVIEW PRIORITY MATRIX
- **CRITICAL REVIEW ITEMS**: Conflicting security recommendations, changes that could break production, database migrations, authentication/authorization changes, recommendations affecting data integrity
- **HIGH REVIEW ITEMS**: Performance optimizations with trade-offs, large refactoring suggestions, dependency updates with breaking changes, architectural modifications
- **MEDIUM REVIEW ITEMS**: Code quality improvements affecting multiple files, testing strategy changes, documentation overhauls, development workflow modifications
- **LOW REVIEW ITEMS**: Style guide updates, minor optimizations, cosmetic improvements, optional enhancements

# REVIEW PROTOCOL PHASES
## Phase 1: Finding Validation
- **False Positive Detection**: Identify findings that don't apply to this codebase
- **Context Verification**: Ensure findings have complete context
- **Pattern Matching**: Verify that detected patterns are actually problematic
- **Framework Compatibility**: Confirm recommendations align with framework best practices
- **Business Logic Check**: Ensure suggestions don't break business requirements

## Phase 2: Consolidation & Deduplication
- **Merge Similar Findings**: Combine related issues into comprehensive fixes
- **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate redundant recommendations across modules
- **Group by Component**: Organize findings by affected system components
- **Dependency Ordering**: Sequence fixes based on dependencies
- **Effort Batching**: Group fixes by implementation effort

## Phase 3: Risk & Impact Analysis
- **Breaking Change Assessment**: Identify changes that could disrupt service
- **Rollback Complexity**: Evaluate how easily changes can be reverted
- **Testing Requirements**: Determine testing needed for each change
- **Performance Impact**: Assess potential performance implications
- **Security Implications**: Review security impact of all recommendations

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance
- **File Path Validation**: Verify all referenced files and line numbers exist
- **Code Sample Accuracy**: Ensure code snippets accurately represent issues
- **Fix Plan Feasibility**: Confirm implementation steps are practical
- **Estimate Refinement**: Adjust effort estimates based on full context
- **Documentation Completeness**: Ensure all findings have clear explanations
