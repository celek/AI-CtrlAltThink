# PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS MODULE

# PERFORMANCE SCAN AREAS
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Identify O(nÂ²) or worse algorithms
- **Database Queries**: Check for N+1 queries, missing indexes, inefficient joins
- **Memory Usage**: Look for memory leaks, large object retention
- **I/O Operations**: Review file operations, network calls, blocking operations
- **Caching**: Identify missing caching opportunities
- **Async Opportunities**: Find blocking operations that could be async

# PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING
Generate baseline performance expectations:
- **Load Testing Recommendations**: Suggest tools and approaches
- **Monitoring Setup**: Recommend performance monitoring integration  
- **Profiling Guidance**: Identify code sections that need profiling

# PERFORMANCE METRICS
